Backtest
==========================

Backtesting betting strategies is crucial to assess their effectiveness and reliability before risking real money.

By systematically evaluating a strategy against historical data, bettors can determine its historical profitability, consistency, and risk profile.

Backtesting helps identify potential pitfalls, such as overfitting or unrealistic assumptions, and provides insights into how a betting approach might perform in future markets.

Ultimately, this process ensures more informed decision-making and increases confidence in deploying betting strategies in real-world scenarios.
