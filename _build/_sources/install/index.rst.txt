Installation
============

``penaltyblog`` can be easily installed from PyPI or built from source. The package is optimized using **Cython**, which requires a C compiler if building from source. However, pre-built wheels are available on PyPI for most modern Python versions and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Installing from PyPI (recommended)
----------------------------------

To install the latest stable release:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install penaltyblog

Installing from Source
----------------------

To install from source, clone the repository and install dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/martineastwood/penaltyblog.git
    cd penaltyblog
    pip install .

Ensure you have a suitable C compiler available (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC) when building from source.
