============

The models and methodologies implemented in penaltyblog are grounded in well-established academic research on football analytics, probability modeling, and betting market efficiency.

The following references include foundational papers on Poisson and Bivariate Poisson models, Dixon-Coles adjustments, Elo and alternative rating systems, and approaches to estimating bookmaker probabilities.

These works have been instrumental in shaping the statistical techniques used within penaltyblog, providing a solid theoretical foundation for accurate football prediction and betting analysis.
