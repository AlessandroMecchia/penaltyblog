Models
==============

Statistical models for predicting outcomes of football (soccer) matches.

Each model is capable of generating the probabilities for multiple betting markets, such as total goals, Asian handicaps and over/under.

If you are interested in the theory behind how the models work then you can take a look at the folowing articles from the `pena.lt/y/blog`_ website:

- `Poisson model`_
- `Dixon and Coles model`_
- `Bayesian Hierarchical model`_
