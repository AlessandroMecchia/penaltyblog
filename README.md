- üìä **Model Matches** ‚Äì Use Poisson, Bivariate Poisson, Dixon-Coles, and more to predict outcomes.
- üí∞ **Bet Smarter** ‚Äì Estimate probabilities for Asian handicaps, over/under, total goals, and more.
- üèÜ **Rank Teams** ‚Äì Rate teams with Elo, Massey, Colley, and Pi methods.
- üìà **Decode Bookmaker Odds** ‚Äì Remove overrounds and extract implied probabilities.
- üéØ **Fantasy Football Optimisation** ‚Äì Build the best squad using mathematical optimisation.

Get started and take your football analytics to the next level! üöÄ
